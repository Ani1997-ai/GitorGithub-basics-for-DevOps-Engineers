## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. It helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate with teams, and manage different versions of projects efficiently.

Key features of Git:

- Tracks code history
- Supports branching and merging
- Enables collaboration via remote repositories (like GitHub)

Why Git is important?

- You never lose cod
- You know everything who changed code what and when
- Multiple people can work on the same project safely
